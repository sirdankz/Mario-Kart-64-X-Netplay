"""Turn a fresh clone plus your own ROM into a bootable Xbox ISO.

This project ships as SOURCE ONLY. Nothing ROM-derived is in the repository,
so a clean clone will not build until you supply `baserom.us.z64` yourself and
run this. `tools/audit_repo_clean.py` is what keeps that true from the other
side; this is what makes it survivable for the person cloning.

WHY THE ORDER IS WHAT IT IS
---------------------------
The chain is not a straight line, and getting it wrong produces confusing
failures rather than obvious ones. Four constraints shape it:

  * THE OUTPUT DIRECTORIES MUST EXIST FIRST. The Makefile creates them up
    front (its ALL_DIRS variable) and the extractors silently rely on that.
    torch does not create its own: it opens the file, the open fails, it
    throws, and the uncaught throw reaches abort() -- which Windows reports as
    `0xC0000409 STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`. That message sends you hunting a
    memory-corruption bug in torch that does not exist. It is a missing mkdir.

  * torch must exist before anything else. It is a git submodule that has to
    be COMPILED, and it is what writes assets/code/** -- 180 files the build
    lists as sources. Without it the RXDK build fails on missing .c files that
    no other step produces.

  * gen_segblobs and gen_dcdata read COMPILED OBJECTS, not source. They dump
    the .data section of each object, exactly as the Dreamcast Makefile does
    with objcopy. So the RXDK build has to run BEFORE them, and again after,
    which is why the build appears twice below. Pass one produces objects;
    pass two packs the dc_data those objects yielded into the ISO.

  * gen_binassets must precede gen_asmwrappers. The wrappers emit `.incbin`
    lines, and a missing file there is DROPPED SILENTLY while still emitting
    its label -- the symbol then aliases whatever asset comes next in memory.
    That is a real bug this project has already been bitten by (Banshee's
    Boos), so the order is load-bearing, not stylistic.

  * gen_binassets reads <objdir>/incbins.txt, and NOTHING in the tree writes
    it -- it was a transient file made by hand during development. It is
    derived here from the decomp's data-only .s files, which is the only
    source that works on a clean tree: deriving it from the generated wrappers
    instead would be circular, since those drop the very entries whose files
    do not exist yet.

Every step declares its outputs and is skipped when they are all present, so
re-running is cheap and safe. Use --force to rebuild regardless.
