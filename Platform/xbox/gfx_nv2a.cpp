/* gfx_nv2a.c — Direct3D 8 / NV2A backend for the MK64 Fast3D renderer.
 *
 * Counterpart to src/gfx/gfx_pvr.c: same struct GfxRenderingAPI, same direct
 * entry points the front-end calls outside the vtable, but targeting the
 * Xbox's NV2A through D3D8 instead of the Dreamcast's PowerVR2.
 *
 * Three structural differences from the PVR backend, all forced by the GPU:
 *
 *  1. NO LIVE LIST. PowerVR is tile-based deferred: one list is open at a time
 *     and opaque geometry streams straight into it through the store queue.
 *     NV2A is immediate-mode, so all three kinds (OP/PT/TR) buffer into
 *     buckets and are drawn in order at end_frame. This costs a little memory
 *     and buys the draw-order control point that (3) needs.
 *
 *  2. NO HARDWARE TRANSPARENCY SORT. PowerVR autosorts the TR list per pixel;
 *     translucency is order-independent for free. NV2A has no such thing, so
 *     the TR bucket is depth-sorted on the CPU before submission. This is the
 *     one place the Xbox is behind the Dreamcast.
 *
 *  3. NO VRAM HEAP. PowerVR textures live in 8MB of separate VRAM behind
 *     pvr_mem_malloc, which is why the PVR backend carries an LRU evictor, an
 *     allocation floor to fight fragmentation, and an OOM watchdog. The Xbox's
 *     64MB is unified: textures are ordinary allocations. The eviction path is
 *     kept but only arms under GFX_XBOX_TEX_BUDGET, since MK64's working set
 *     fits comfortably.
 *
 * The colour combiner is still evaluated per-vertex on the CPU by the
 * front-end (pvr_eval_combiner), exactly as on Dreamcast, and arrives baked
 * into each vertex's diffuse + specular. That is deliberate for this stage:
 * it reproduces the Dreamcast's known-good output on new hardware before the
 * register-combiner path replaces it. NV2A can evaluate (a-b)*c+d per pixel in
 * its 8 general combiner stages; wiring that up is the next step and will
 * delete the CPU evaluator entirely.
